        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <p>Apollo make Vibrating Screen consists of two spherical
roller bearings in each housing with bore sizes up to
140mm. These housings are connected using a cardan
shaft which reduces the weight of the vibrator mechanism,
reduces shaft deflection and increases the space between
the decks when changing screen media. This innovative design ensures that bearing changes or counterweight
adjustments can be made with minimum downtime keeping screens working productively. The bearing housings
fitted with specifically designed bearings for vibratory aplications are designed to accomodate thermal expansion.
The Vibrating Screens are also available with conventional two bearing design.</p>
